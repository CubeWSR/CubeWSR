    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p> I created this webpage to keep a log and express my love for K-dramas I watched on Netflix. Writing reviews helps me unpack my thoughts and feelings about each show, creating a personal record to revisit. It provides an honest and detailed opinion if someone asks about a series. Sharing my reviews online helps others make informed choices about which series to watch.</p><br>
